## Image Optimization Tips

- Use PNG format for logos (with transparency if needed)
- Use PNG or JPG for screenshots
- Optimize images before adding (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB per image when possible)
- Maintain aspect ratios for screenshots

## Adding Images

1. Save your logo as `dinkli-logo.png` in the `images/logos/` folder
2. Save your app screenshots in the `images/app-screenshots/` folder with the exact filenames listed above
3. The website will automatically display them once the files are in place

## Temporary Placeholders

If images are missing, the browser will show broken image icons. Make sure to add all images before going live!
